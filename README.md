# RAW-NODE-API-Project with Twilio
An uptime monitoring system for clients using only node js.

I just wanted to express how thrilled and satisfied I am with the work that I have just completed. It was no small feat, and I put in a lot of hard work and dedication to get to this point. I followed 'Learn with Sumit' YouTube videos. I faced some difficulties as the tutorial is about 2 years old and some syntaxes and functionalities are being deprecated or changed. So I googled and tried to solve on my own. It also helped me to google more efficiently and filter my search according to my needs.

The things I've implemented in the project are:
1. CRUDing 'user' using 4 methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. CRUDing 'token'.
3. CRUDing check.
4. Twilio SMS service.
5. If any website's state changes then the user will be notified through SMS.

I am grateful to Mr. Sumit Saha for his amazing YouTube channel. Hope he continues to make these wonderful tutorials though these are free. I am grateful for the skills and knowledge that I have gained through this experience. I am looking forward to celebrating this achievement and reflecting on all that I have learned.

Thank you.
